Permutations (subject)

Expected files: *.c *.h
Allowed functions: puts, malloc, calloc, free, write

Write a program that will print all the permutations of a string given as an argument. The solutions must be given in alphabetical order. We will not try your program with strings containing duplicates (eg: ‘abccd’). For example this should work:

./permutations a | cat -e
a
./permutations ab | cat -e
ab
ba
./permutations abc | cat -e
abc
acb
bac
bca
cab
cba
