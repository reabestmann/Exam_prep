(short ver)

Assignment name: filter
Expected files: filter.c
Allowed functions & globals: read, write, strlen, memmem, memmove, malloc, calloc, realloc, free, printf, fprintf, stdout, stderr, perror

Write a program that will take one and only one argument s. It will then read from stdin and write all the sonten read in stdout except that everz occurence of s must be replaces by '*'.

./filter abc
will behave in the same way as sed 's/abc/***/g'

In case of error during a read or a malloc, you must write "Error: " followed by the error message in stderr and return 1. If the programm is called without arguments or with an empty argument or with multiple arguments, it must return 1. 
For example this should work:

echo 'abcdefaaaaaabcdeabcdabc' | ./filter abc | cat -e
***defaaaaa***de***d***
