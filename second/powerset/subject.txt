Write a program that takes an integer n followed by a set s of distingt integers as an argument. Your program should display all the subsets of s whose sum of elements in n. The order of the lines is not important, but the order of elements in a subset is: it must match the order in the initial set s. This way, you should not have any duplicates (eg: '1 2' and '2 1').
For example using the command

./powerset 5 1 2 3 4 5

this output is valid:
1 4
2 3
5

this one is also valid:
2 3
5 
1 4

but this one is not:
4 1
3 2
5

In case of a malloc error your program must exit with the code 1. We will not test with invalid sets (for example '1 1 2'). Hint: the empty subset is a valid subset of any set. It will be displayed as an empty line. For example this should work:

./powerset 3 1 0 2 4 5 3 | cat -e
3
0 3
1 2
1 0 2

./powerset 12 5 2 1 8 4 3 7 11 | cat -e
8 4
1 11
1 4 7
1 8 3
2 3 7
5 7
5 4 3
5 2 1 4

./powerset 0 1 -1 | cat -e
$
1 -1

./powerset 7 3 8 2 | cat -e
